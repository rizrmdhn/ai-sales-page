# Video Script — AI Sales Page Generator Walkthrough

**Target length:** 5–7 minutes  
**Format:** Screen recording with voiceover

---

## [0:00 – 0:30] Intro

> "This is an AI-powered sales page generator built with a modern TypeScript full-stack. You give it your product details — name, description, features, pricing — and it produces a fully written sales page in seconds using a large language model. Let me walk through how it works from the UI all the way down to the AI call."

Show: landing/login page of the app.

---

## [0:30 – 1:30] Live Demo (User Flow)

> "First I'll show you what the app actually does before we go into the code."

1. Log in with a test account
2. Navigate to **New Page**
3. Fill in the form:
   - Product Name: `FlowDesk Pro`
   - Description: `An AI-powered CRM that automates follow-ups`
   - Features: add 3–4 bullet points
   - Target Audience, Price, USP
4. Hit **Generate**
5. Show loading state (status: pending)
6. Page loads — show the rendered result: headline, benefits, features, CTA
7. Jump to dashboard — show the card with "generated" status

> "That's the full user flow. Now let's look at how it's built."

---

## [1:30 – 2:15] Project Structure

> "The project is a Turborepo monorepo. Two apps — a React frontend and a Hono backend — plus a set of shared packages."

Show: file tree in the editor

> "The key packages are:
> - `packages/ai` — the Groq prompt and generation logic
> - `packages/api` — tRPC routers for auth and sales pages
> - `packages/schema` — Zod schemas shared by both frontend and backend
> - `packages/db` — Drizzle ORM schema and queries"

---

## [2:15 – 3:15] Data Flow — Frontend to Backend

> "When the user submits the form, here's what happens."

Show: `apps/web/src/routes/(core)/new-page.tsx`

> "React Hook Form handles the form state. On submit, it fires a tRPC mutation — `salesPage.create` — passing the validated input."

Show: `packages/api/src/routers/sales-page.ts` — `create` procedure

> "On the backend, we first write a record to the database with status `pending`. Then we call `generateSalesPage()`. If that succeeds, we update the record to `generated` and store the AI response as JSONB. If it fails, the status becomes `failed` — and the user can retry from the dashboard."

---

## [3:15 – 4:15] The AI Layer

> "The AI logic lives entirely in `packages/ai`."

Show: `packages/ai/src/prompt.ts`

> "The system prompt tells the model it's a professional copywriter. The user message injects all six product fields and specifies exactly what JSON structure to return — headline, sub-headline, benefits array, features with titles and descriptions, social proof, pricing, and a CTA."

Show: `packages/ai/src/index.ts`

> "We use the Groq SDK with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. The `response_format` is set to `json_object` — this forces the model to return valid JSON rather than free-form text. We parse the response and return it typed as `GeneratedContent`."

---

## [4:15 – 5:00] Type Safety End-to-End

> "One of the things this stack does well is type safety all the way through."

Show: `packages/schema/src/prompt.schema.ts` → `packages/api` input validation → frontend form

> "`promptSchema` is defined once with Zod and used for both frontend validation and backend parsing via tRPC. The `GeneratedContent` type flows from the DB type definition through tRPC to the frontend component — no manual casting anywhere."

Show: `packages/db/src/types.ts` and `apps/web/src/routes/(core)/sales-pages/$id.tsx`

> "The frontend just destructures the typed response and renders each section."

---

## [5:00 – 5:30] Auth & Dashboard

> "Authentication uses short-lived JWT access tokens (15 minutes) paired with refresh tokens stored in the database — so sessions can be revoked on logout."

Show: `packages/auth/src/index.ts` briefly

> "Every tRPC route that touches sales pages uses a `protectedProcedure` — it verifies the JWT and attaches the user to context before the handler runs."

Show: dashboard briefly — search, delete, retry buttons

> "The dashboard lets users search their pages, delete them, or retry any that failed — without re-entering the product details."

---

## [5:30 – 6:00] Wrap Up

> "To summarize: the user fills in 6 fields, tRPC sends them to the server, Groq generates structured JSON, and the frontend renders a complete sales page. The whole thing is type-safe from the database to the UI, built on React, Hono, tRPC, Drizzle, and Groq."

> "Thanks for watching."

Show: final generated sales page on screen.

## Recording Notes

- Keep terminal/editor font large (16pt+)
- Pause 1–2 seconds on each file before speaking
- Highlight the specific lines being discussed
- Keep the demo data realistic — avoid "test123" as product names
